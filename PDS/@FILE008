//***FILE 008 now contains the jobs used by Sam Golob to create     *   FILE 008
//*           this tape.  This stuff (in Arnie's time) used to      *   FILE 008
//*       be part of File 001, but it was taken out by Sam Golob    *   FILE 008
//*       for lack of space.  Also, the jobs at the Connecticut     *   FILE 008
//*       Bank used different JCL than we now use.  So we are       *   FILE 008
//*       now re-inserting our JCL on the CBT Tape here in          *   FILE 008
//*       File 008, so you can get an idea about how this tape      *   FILE 008

//*        leave it out.  Arnie Casinghino forged the spirit        *   FILE 008
//*        of this collection, and dedicated his every extra        *   FILE 008
//*        effort to its continuance.  I had a very big act         *   FILE 008
//*        to follow, in trying to maintain and enhance Arnie's     *   FILE 008
//*        work of 15 years.  Arnie definitely set the tone         *   FILE 008

//*        I kept the tape up across an assortment of jobs,         *   FILE 008
//*        and also through the kindness of several data            *   FILE 008
//*        centers, all of whom are owed a big "thank you".         *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        VERY VERY SPECIAL THANKS go to the late Gilbert          *   FILE 008
//*        Saint-flour, who left us far too soon.  Gilbert was      *   FILE 008
//*        solely responsible for providing a work platform         *   FILE 008
//*        to support the making of this tape, for at least         *   FILE 008
//*        5 years.  He owned a P/390 that he used, to run his      *   FILE 008
//*        business, and he gave me a userid on his machine         *   FILE 008
//*        so I could support the CBT Tape from there.              *   FILE 008
//*        Gilbert also owned tape drives, and I lived near him.    *   FILE 008
//*        Later on, when I was working at an MVS site in           *   FILE 008
//*        another company, the lines were always open to           *   FILE 008
//*        Gilbert's machine as well, so that everything could      *   FILE 008
//*        be preserved and none of the material ever got lost.     *   FILE 008
//*        BTW this was with written permission from that           *   FILE 008
//*        company.                                                 *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        More thanks........                                      *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Also, big thanks have to go to Scott Sherer and          *   FILE 008
//*        NaSPA, for contracting to duplicate the tapes after      *   FILE 008
//*        I made the first one.  This went on for almost ten       *   FILE 008
//*        years, until we started the www.cbttape.org website      *   FILE 008
//*        at the end of 1998.  NaSPA's support began in 1989,      *   FILE 008
//*        when Arnie was still making CBT Tapes at CBT.            *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Even before Arnie's shop lost their tape drives,         *   FILE 008
//*        Scott and NaSPA were already duplicating CBT tapes       *   FILE 008
//*        at Deluxe Check Printers.  Credit goes to Marty Kuntz    *   FILE 008
//*        who actually worked duplicating the tapes at Deluxe.     *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Arnie's "Connecticut Bank & Trust" data center           *   FILE 008
//*        got rid of their tape drives in 1990.                    *   FILE 008
//*        (We had about 1 1/2 years' advance warning before        *   FILE 008
//*        we were obligated to completely switch over).            *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Even more special thanks go to Sam Knutson, who          *   FILE 008
//*        started the website, paid for it himself for a while,    *   FILE 008
//*        and is still paying for it.  He administers it, and      *   FILE 008
//*        so forth.  The fact that he gave it to a reliable IT     *   FILE 008
//*        provider with much redundancy and almost no down         *   FILE 008
//*        time, is a great boon to someone who doing an IPL        *   FILE 008
//*        of a new system during off hours, and especially         *   FILE 008
//*        on a Sunday.  The availability is fantastic.             *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        We owe a big debt of gratitude to Innovation Data        *   FILE 008
//*        Processing, the makers of FDR and other fine software    *   FILE 008
//*        products, for sponsoring the www.cbttape.org web site    *   FILE 008
//*        during much of its existence (for at least 15 or 16      *   FILE 008
//*        years).  Thanks to John Mazzone in particular.           *   FILE 008
//*        Innovation got bought by Compuware, which got bought     *   FILE 008
//*        by BMC Software, but we still owe a great deal of        *   FILE 008

//*        version of z/OS, you can hunt around on our site for     *   FILE 008
//*        a newer version of what broke, and the hour doesn't      *   FILE 008

//*        the Internet) in several satchels.  My father gave       *   FILE 008
//*        me a few months off, so I could work at an MVS           *   FILE 008
//*        site and make CBT Tapes there.  Many thanks to him too!  *   FILE 008
//*        (He allowed me to accept the contract at Brooklyn        *   FILE 008
//*        College while I was still working for him.)              *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        More thanks go to the many contributors of material.     *   FILE 008
//*        THE ENTIRE COLLECTION DEPENDS ON ALL OF YOU.......       *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Separate thanks go to people who help me fix things      *   FILE 008
//*        on a regular basis:  John McKown, Bill Godfrey, Greg     *   FILE 008
//*        Price, John Kalinich, Ze'ev Atlas, Gabriel Gargiulo,     *   FILE 008
//*        Roland Schiradin, Willy Jensen, Robert AH Prins, Rob     *   FILE 008
//*        Prins (two different people), and many, many others.     *   FILE 008
//*        I can't mention everybody, but many thanks go to you     *   FILE 008
//*        all...!!                                                 *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Other thanks go to people who insisted that I NOT        *   FILE 008
//*        BE ABLE TO MAKE ONE PENNY from this endeavor.  It        *   FILE 008
//*        has certainly kept the spirit of the CBT Tape up,        *   FILE 008
//*        and the costs down.  All the best of everything to       *   FILE 008
//*        all of you.  (I mean it.)  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE...!!     *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        R.I.P. to Dave Andrews and John Hooper, my dear friends. *   FILE 008
//*               And of course to Rick Fochtman, Ken Tomiak,       *   FILE 008
//*               Gerhard Postpischil, and Eugene Vogt.             *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        John Hooper is responsible for very reliable code,       *   FILE 008
//*        in CBT File 019.                                         *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        Much of Gerhard's code is in CBT Files 860, 861, & 862.  *   FILE 008
//*        These are very large files, and are worth exploration.   *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
//*        You all owe Dave Andrews and his former boss, Bill       *   FILE 008
//*        Winters, for the fact that you are able to have the      *   FILE 008
//*        HLASM Assembler.  WITHOUT THEM, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE IT.    *   FILE 008
//*        Both of them have also passed on, as has John Ehrman.    *   FILE 008
//*        We have to be grateful to all of them, for their work.   *   FILE 008
//*                                                                 *   FILE 008
