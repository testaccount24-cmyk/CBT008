Note regarding DFDSS backups of the CBT volume, CBTA01.

It has been pointed out that due to many changes in the program
ADRDSSU (the program which does DFDSS backups of disk volumes),
in z/OS 2.3, backups done with z/OS 2.3 sometimes can not be
restored on systems running z/OS 2.2 or earlier.

Of course, backups done with ADRDSSU on a 2.3 system can be
restored on z/OS 2.3, but since they can't be restored on 2.2 or
2.1 or earlier, we have decided to take these full-pack backups
using a copy of ADRDSSU from a z/OS 2.2 system.  This seems to
be capable of being restored on earlier systems.

Please look for questions or evidence regarding this.
