Note:  I used most of the members on this file to make the CBT Tape
       Version 507.  Since the file was used to make the tape, the
       copy of File 008 that is on V507 of the tape, is not identical
       to all the jobs used to make the tape actually.

       This file is closer to accuracy.

       What can one do?  I needed this file to make the tape, and
       then I had to make the tape over several times, in order to
       include more updated members from this file on it.

       Now that V507 is done, I've updated this file to more accurately
       reflect the actual jobs used to make the actual V507 tape.
